# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

**Core value:** The app should look and feel like it was built in 2025 — clean, minimal, professional — so users trust it enough to book services and pay through it.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: GLBL-01 (no all-caps headings) and GLBL-04 (consistent spacing) assigned to Phase 1 — these are token/foundation concerns that must be established before visual work begins
- [Roadmap]: GLBL-02 (action verb CTAs) and GLBL-03 (inline form validation) assigned to Phase 6 — provider detail has the primary forms and CTAs; these are audited and enforced there
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (Provider Cards) depends on Phase 1, not Phase 3 — cards must be unified before search and landing page are considered complete
- [Research]: Phase 5 (Search/Browse) flagged for phase research — Mapbox GL dynamic marker updates and custom popup styling have known implementation-specific gotchas

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5]: Mapbox GL custom map marker styling with provider name/price tooltip on hover — sparse documentation for this specific pattern. Needs a spike during phase planning before committing to design.
- [Research gap]: No analytics data on actual mobile vs. desktop traffic split. Assumption is mobile-primary for customers. Validate before finalizing Phase 5 map/list toggle priority.
